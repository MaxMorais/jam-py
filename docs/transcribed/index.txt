The transcript from video tutorials
===================================

The idea when added this part of the jam.py documentation was to transfer video 
tutorials by Mr. Andrew Yushev in text format and a look at some pieces of code 
that are often appear and repeat in specific places. 

Thus, the adoption of general principles for application development with this 
exceptional framework should be greatly facilitated.
