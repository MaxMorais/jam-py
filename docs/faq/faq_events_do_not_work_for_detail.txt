=============================
Events do not work for detail
=============================

There are different types of details.

Firstly, the items that are in the Detail group in the project tree

They are the same as items in other groups such as Journals, Catalogs or
any other that you can create. The only difference is that they has two
additional fields ``master_id`` and ``master_rec_id``, that are used to store 
information about the ``ID`` of the master (each item have its own unique ID) 
and the value of the primary field of the record of its master.

When you link detail to the master item

	:alt: Linking detail to master

Application Builder creates a new item that have its own attributes and client 
and server modules. 

To access it, expand the group to which the master belongs, select the master in 
the project tree, and when the master details appear in the table in the middle 
of the screen, select the details.

You can link one detail to different masters and setup these master details 
differently.
